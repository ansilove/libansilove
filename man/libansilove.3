.Sh NAME
.Nm libansilove
.Nd Library for converting ANSI, ASCII, and other formats to PNG
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a library to convert ANSi and artscene related file formats into PNG
images, supporting ANSI (.ANS), PCBoard (.PCB), Binary (.BIN), Artworx
(.ADF), iCE Draw (.IDF), Tundra (.TND) and XBin (.XB) formats.
.Pp
It creates size optimized 4-bit PNG files and supports 80x25 and 80x50
PC fonts (including all the 14 MS-DOS charsets), Amiga and Atari fonts,
and iCE colors.
.Pp
All library functions take a context, defined as an
.Em ansilove_ctx
structure in
.Pa include/ansilove.h :
.Bd -literal
struct ansilove_ctx {
        uint8_t *buffer;
        size_t maplen;
        size_t length;
        struct ansilove_png png;
        uint8_t error;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Options are passed to the different loaders using the
.Em ansilove_options
structure in
.Pa include/ansilove.h :
.Bd -literal
struct ansilove_options {
        bool diz;
        bool dos;
        bool icecolors;
        bool truecolor;
        int16_t columns;
        uint8_t font;
        uint8_t bits;
        uint8_t mode;
        uint8_t scale_factor;
};
